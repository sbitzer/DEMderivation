  abstract = {This paper describes a general model that subsumes many parametric
	models for continuous data. The model comprises hidden layers of
	state-space or dynamic causal models, arranged so that the output
	of one provides input to another. The ensuing hierarchy furnishes
	a model for many types of data, of arbitrary complexity. Special
	cases range from the general linear model for static data to generalised
	convolution models, with system noise, for nonlinear time-series
	analysis. Crucially, all of these models can be inverted using exactly
	the same scheme, namely, dynamic expectation maximization. This means
	that a single model and optimisation scheme can be used to invert
	a wide range of models. We present the model and a brief review of
	its inversion to disclose the relationships among, apparently, diverse
	generative models of empirical data. We then show that this inversion
	can be formulated as a simple neural network and may provide a useful
	metaphor for inference and learning in the brain.},

  title = {{DEM}: A variational treatment of dynamic systems},
  journal = {NeuroImage},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {41},
  pages = {849 - 885},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {This paper presents a variational treatment of dynamic models that
	furnishes time-dependent conditional densities on the path or trajectory
	of a system's states and the time-independent densities of its parameters.
	These are obtained by maximising a variational action with respect
	to conditional densities, under a fixed-form assumption about their
	form. The action or path-integral of free-energy represents a lower
	bound on the model's log-evidence or marginal likelihood required
	for model selection and averaging. This approach rests on formulating
	the optimisation dynamically, in generalised coordinates of motion.
	The resulting scheme can be used for online Bayesian inversion of
	nonlinear dynamic causal models and is shown to outperform existing
	approaches, such as Kalman and particle filtering. Furthermore, it
	provides for dual and triple inferences on a system's states, parameters
	and hyperparameters using exactly the same principles. We refer to
	this approach as dynamic expectation maximisation (DEM).},
